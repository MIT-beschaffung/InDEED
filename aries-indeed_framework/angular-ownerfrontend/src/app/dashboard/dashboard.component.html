  <h2>Welcome to the Asset Logging Test Frontend!</h2>
  <div class="pb-3" >In the project InDEED, we evaluate potential use cases within the digital transformation of the energy sector,
    with a special focus on potential applications of blockchain technology for providing a decentralized and neutral digital infrastructure.
    The use case “Asset logging” thereby describes the transparent, tamper-resistant and automated documentation of asset data to prove data integrity
    and to automate verification process flows.
    For instance, this may help to facilitate a fully-automatic notarization of dynamic data, which can
    then be used, for instance, in a lawsuit.
  </div>
  <div class ="pb-3 ">
    A part of the InDEED platform hence enables the verification of dynamic data generated by assets in the energy sector (but even more general)
    that are connected to our platform.
    For our field test, data is captured from test assets of our partner liqwotec.
    To facilitate data integrity verification without compromising the confidentiality of sensitive information and our solution’s scalability,
    the data is hashed in a Merkle Tree to create a Merkle Root – a character sequence formed by mathematical operation –
    which is then stored on a private Ethereum (Consensys Quorum) blockchain
    that is currently running on a server provided by the University of Bayreuth.
    A Merkle Proof can then be generated for each data entry.
  </div>
  <div class="pb-3 ">
    The Merkle proof, in combination with a pointer to the blockchain write transaction that stores the Merkle root,
    can then be used to verify the data’s integrity from the timestamp of publication onwards.
    This enables tamper-resistant and at the same time scalable and efficient documentation.
    For the demonstration of the data notarization and verification process,
    the information to be notarized is first uploaded as file that stores one or multiple JSON objects (as an array).
    The InDEED backend then computes the corresponding notarizationProof by creating a Merkle proof and writing a blockchain transaction.
    The user can then download the notarizationProof.
    To verify the integrity of the data, one can upload or paste the notarized asset data captured previously.
